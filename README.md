👋 Hi, I’m @ErsinAKTURK
👀 I’m deeply interested in front-end/ React / React Native software development.
🌱 Currently working on HTML5, CSS, Java, React, Typescript.
You can reach out to some of my projects with UDEMIG.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on changing experiences mutually.
I like the endless possibilities of coding and the millions of ways to tackle problems.
I really, really like to learn new things, see new places, and meet new people. This is how I feed my soul and achieve knowledge expansion and satisfaction by interacting with my team and people.
I also identify myself as a team leader and player, focusing on problem-solving rather than focusing on the problem itself due to my 25+ years of military and management background and experiences.
📫 please get in touch with me whenever you want through my email address, ersinakturk74@gmail.com.
